# ROTATE_TRIANGLE_CONSOLE

Perhaps you have already seen a console implementation of a cube implemented in C, which was written by YouTuber Servet Gulnaroglu... after watching his video, I decided to do almost the same thing, but to make not a cube, but a triangle, in C++. I will say in advance, all those formulas that I used (namely the 3D rotation formulas in Wikipedia) are exactly the same, since I am not doing 2D, but 3D. However, there will still be a small difference, and I will try to explain and show with an example.
